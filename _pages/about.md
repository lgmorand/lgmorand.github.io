## About me

My name is Louis-Guillaume MORAND, an almost 40 years old geek (+almost already bald). I was a developer the first 20 years before starting to move on architecture side. Found of DevOps, DevSecOps and more recently in the k8s world, I always loved to share the little of knowledge I acquired

Today I spend my free time writing (technical books) or internal content for Microsoft and our customers. Always loving a technical chat around a good glass of wine, I'm also super famous for being grumpy.

look, a big picture of me. you are allowed to use it as wallpaper if you want

We’re excited to announce that the new and improved Azure OpenAI content filters are ready and will be turned on in the week of February 13, 2023!
 
What’s new? 
With our latest update we’re providing content filters with significant quality and precision improvements. We have adjusted the system to filter at higher severity levels with each category (Hate and Fairness, Sexual, Violence, Self-harm) and expanded coverage across other languages. 

Once the filters are turned back on, the system will resume blocking harmful prompts and model generations. If applicable, custom settings will be reactivated, and content filters will remain off for customers that have been approved for an exemption. More information about the AOAI content management system can be found here. If you would like to report an issue or provide feedback, please open an Azure support request.
